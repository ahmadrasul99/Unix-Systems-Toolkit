All the commands implemented in my toolkit are implemented as internal commands. I implemented the
commands as internal due to the fact that their execution would be fast in the sense that the shell
doesnâ€™t have to search the given path for them. Also, no process needs to be spawned for its execution.

Custom commands implemented:
  myexit,
  mycd,
  mypwd,
  mytree,
  mytime.
  
All existing external UNIX commands are implemented successfully.

Able to support multiple pipes (up to 10 in a command line). However, custom commands cannot be used with pipes.

Termination upon receiving EOF (CTRL+D) not implemented.

I/O redirection is not implemented.
