All the commands implemented in my toolkit are implemented as internal commands. I implemented the
commands as internal due to the fact that their execution would be fast in the sense that the shell
doesnâ€™t have to search the given path for them. Also, no process needs to be spawned for its execution.

Custom commands:
  myexit      implemented successfully
  mycd        implemented successfully
  mypwd       implemented successfully
  mytree      implemented successfully
  mytime      partially implemented; displays system CPU time and elapsed time but unable to show user CPU time
  mymtimes    not implemented
  mytimeout   not implemented

Termination upon receiving EOF (CTRL+D) not implemented.

All existing external UNIX commands are implemented successfully.

Able to support multiple pipes (up to 10 in a command line). However, custom commands cannot be used with pipes.
  successful usage      ls -al | sort | wc
  unsuccessful usage    mypwd | wc

I/O redirection is not implemented.
